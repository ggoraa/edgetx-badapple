# Bad Apple .lua script for EdgeTX-powered radios

This project allows playing a Bad Apple on an EdgeTX-powered radio,
and for now only tested on a Taranis Q X7. I managed to fully run it 
only in a simulator, just because it doesn't have any memory restrictions.
Currently there is effort going on to make it run on a real device.
